Description

This project is the first step toward building a simplified clone of the AirBnB web app. It includes a command-line interface (CLI) that lets you create, update, delete, and manage data models, similar to how a real backend works. This console also stores and reloads data using a file-based storage system (JSON). Later parts of the project will include a web front-end, database storage, API, and dynamic content.

How It Works

Command Interpreter

The console (console.py) lets users interact with the system like a shell.

Features:

Create new objects (users, places, etc.)

Retrieve existing objects

Update object attributes

Delete objects

Save/load data from a JSON file (persistence)Description
